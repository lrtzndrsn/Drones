This is a mini-project that utilizes the OO-functionality of F#


## To run the code: 
* 1. Open mono command prompt
* 2. Locate the files simulate.fs and testSimulate.fsx in the src-folder. 
* 3. When these file has been located in the folder, type in the following in your cmd:

* dotnet fsi _(this will enter F# interactive mode)_
* \#load "simulate.fs" _(this will load the simulate script)_
* \#load "testSimulate.fsx";; _(this will load and run the tests)_

Now you should be able to see the tests running
